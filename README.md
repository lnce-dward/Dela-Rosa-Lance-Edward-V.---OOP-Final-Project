# Health Tracking System

## Introduction

The Health Tracking System is designed to help individuals monitor and improve their physical and mental health. It provides a user-friendly platform where users can track key health metrics, including weight, BMI, blood pressure, heart rate, stress levels, mood, and more. The system is built using Object-Oriented Programming principles, ensuring maintainability, reusability, and scalability.

This project addresses the **Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3: Good Health and Well-being** by encouraging individuals to take control of their health and make informed decisions based on real-time data. By using the system, users can monitor their physical health progress, manage stress, and track their mood, ultimately promoting overall well-being.

## Technologies

- **Java**: Core language for implementing the system.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Applied to create modular, maintainable, and reusable code.
- **IntelliJ IDEA**: Recommended IDE for building and running the project.

## Features

- **User Registration and Login**: Allows users to create an account, log in, and securely store personal health data.
- **Physical Health Tracking**: Users can input and track their weight, height, blood pressure, heart rate, and calculate BMI.
- **Mental Health Tracking**: Users can log their mood, stress levels, and track cognitive well-being.
- **Health History**: Displays a history of previous health entries and allows users to view their progress over time.
- **Database Integration**: Stores and retrieves health data from a MySQL database.

## SDG Integration

The system is aligned with **SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being**, which emphasizes the importance of promoting healthy lives and well-being for all at all ages. This project supports this goal by providing a platform for individuals to monitor and improve their physical and mental health, ultimately leading to better health outcomes.

### How SDG 3 is addressed:
- **Physical Health Monitoring**: Users can track key physical health metrics such as weight, BMI, and blood pressure, enabling them to manage their physical well-being effectively.
- **Mental Health Support**: By tracking mood and stress levels, the system helps users better understand and manage their mental health.
- **Access to Health Data**: The system encourages users to regularly assess their health data, promoting proactive health management.
